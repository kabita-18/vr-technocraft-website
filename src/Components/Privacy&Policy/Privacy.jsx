        <h2 id="use-of-cookies">Use of Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          The Vr technocraft website may use “cookies” to help you personalize
          your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your
          hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs
          or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to
          you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued
          the cookie to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
          feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
          server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
          personalize Vr technocraft pages, or register with Vr technocraft site
          or services, a cookie helps Vr technocraft to recall your specific
          information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Vr
          technocraft website, the information you previously provided can be
          retrieved, so you can easily use the Vr technocraft features that you
          customized.

        <p>
          You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
          automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
          setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
          cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive

          Information Uses, Sharing, and Disclosure

          When you access or use the Services, we collect, use, share, and
          otherwise process your personal information as described in this
          policy. We rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in
          these ways. These legal bases include where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            necessary to perform the contractual obligations in our Terms of Use
            and in order to provide the Services to you;
          </li>
          <li>
            you have consented to the processing, which you can revoke at any
            time;
          </li>
          <li>
            necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to
            exercise or defend legal claims;
          </li>
          <li>
            necessary for the purposes of our or a third party’s legitimate
            interests, such as those of visitors, members, or partners;

          <li>you have expressly made the information public;</li>
          <li>necessary in the public interest; and</li>
          <li>
            occasionally necessary to protect your vital interests, or those of
            others.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that we principally rely on consent (i) to send marketing
          messages, (ii) for third-party data sharing related to advertising,
          and, to the extent applicable, (iii) for the use of location data for
          advertising purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where we process your information on the basis of legitimate
          interests, we do so as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Providing and improving our Services:</strong> We may use your
          information to improve and customize our Services, including sharing
          of your information for such purposes, and we do so as it is necessary
          to pursue our legitimate interests of improving our Services for our
          users. This is also necessary to enable us to pursue our legitimate
          interests in understanding how our Services are being used, and to
          explore and unlock ways to develop and grow our business. It is also
          necessary to allow us to pursue our legitimate interests in improving
          our Services, efficiency, interest in Services for users and obtaining
          insights into usage patterns of our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Keeping our Services safe and secure:</strong> We may also use
          your information for safety and security purposes, including sharing
          of your information for such purposes, and we do so because it is
          necessary to pursue our legitimate interests in ensuring the security
          of our Services, including enhancing protection of our community
          against spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime,
          and security risks of all kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          We respect your privacy. We use your information to provide and
          improve the Services and our products, for billing and payments, for
          identification and authentication, for targeted online and offline
          marketing including through tools like Facebook Custom Audience and
          Google Customer Match, to contact members or interested parties, and
          for general research and aggregate reporting. For example, in
          accordance with our existing case resolution process, we may use
          information you provide to resolve disputes with Vr technocraft or
          other members. We may learn the sorts of products that you’re
          interested in from your browsing and purchasing behavior on (and off)
          the Site or Apps and suggest potential purchases as a result. As a
          core part of our Services, we have a legitimate interest in
          customizing your on-site experience to help you discover relevant
          information. As part of this, we may work with advertising partners
          such as Facebook or Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Legal and Safety:</strong> Vr technocraft may also retain,
          preserve, or release your personal information to a third party in the
          following limited circumstances: in response to lawful requests by
          public authorities, including to meet legitimate national security or
          law enforcement requirements; to protect, establish, or exercise our
          legal rights or defend against legal claims, including to collect a
          debt; to comply with a subpoena, court order, legal process, or other
          legal requirement; or when we believe in good faith that such
          disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, prevent
          imminent physical harm or financial loss, or investigate, prevent, or
          take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to
          our property, or violations of Vr technocraft’s Terms of Use. In these
          cases, our use of your information may be necessary for the purposes
          of our or a third party’s legitimate interest in keeping our Services
          secure, preventing harm or crime, enforcing or defending legal rights,
          or preventing damage. Such use may also be necessary to comply with a
          legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise or defend legal
          claims. It may also be necessary in the public interest (such as to
          prevent crime) or to protect vital interests (in rare cases where we
          may need to share information to prevent loss of life or personal
          injury).
        </p>
        <p>
          If Vr technocraft receives a lawful, verified request for a member’s
          records or information in one of the limited circumstances described
          in the previous paragraph, Vr technocraft may disclose personal
          information, which may include, but may not be limited to, a user’s
          name, address, phone number, email address, and company name.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Affiliated Businesses:</strong> Vr technocraft is affiliated
          with a variety of businesses and works closely with them for a variety
          of purposes, including assisting us to perform and improve the
          Services. These businesses may sell items or services to you through
          the Services or, with your consent, offer promotions (including email
          promotions) to you. Vr technocraft may also provide services or sell
          products jointly with affiliated businesses, including providing
          information to such partners to allow them to more effectively market
          to you. When an affiliated business assists in facilitating your
          transaction, we may need to share information related to the
          transaction with that affiliated business in order to facilitate your
          transaction, and this forms part of the Services we provide in
          accordance with our Terms of Use. We rely on consent (which can be
          withdrawn at any time) to send marketing messages and for third-party
          sharing relating to advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Aggregated Information:</strong> Vr technocraft may share
          aggregated and de-personalized information, so that personal
          information is not revealed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Service Providers:</strong> Vr technocraft also needs to
          engage third-party companies and individuals (such as payment
          processors, research companies, and analytics and security providers)
          to help us operate, provide, and market the Services. These third
          parties have only limited access to your information, may use your
          information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are
          obligated to Vr technocraft not to disclose or use your information
          for other purposes. Our engagement of service providers is often
          necessary for us to provide the Services to you, particularly where
          such companies play important roles like processing payments and
          shipments and helping us keep our Service operating and secure. In
          some other cases, these service providers aren’t strictly necessary
          for us to provide the Services, but help us make it better, like by
          helping us conduct research into how we could better serve our users.
          In these latter cases, we have a legitimate interest in working with
          service providers to make our Services better.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Business Reorganization:</strong> In some cases, Vr
          technocraft may choose to buy or sell assets. Such transactions may be
          necessary and in our legitimate interests, particularly our interest
          in making decisions that enable our business to develop over the long
          term. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger,
          liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of
          Vr technocraft’s assets), member information is typically one of the
          business assets that is transferred.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Third Parties:</strong> Third-party plug-ins also may collect
          information about your use of the Site. For example, when you load a
          page on Vr technocraft that has a social plug-in from a third-party
          site or service, such as a “Like” or “Send” button, you are also
          loading content from that third-party site. That site may request
          cookies directly from your browser. These interactions are subject to
          the privacy policy of the third-party site. In addition, certain
          cookies and other similar technologies on the Site are used by third
          parties for targeted online marketing and other purposes. These
          technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer or mobile
          device each time you use the Services. Please be aware that when you
          use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy
          policies will govern your use of those sites or services. Vr
          technocraft chooses and manages these third-party technologies placed
          on its Sites and Apps. However, these are third-party technologies,
          and they are subject to that third party’s privacy policy. We rely on
          your consent to drop and read non-technically necessary cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can speak only for ourselves; this policy does not apply to the
          practices of third parties that Vr technocraft does not own or control
          or individuals that Vr technocraft does not employ or manage. If you
          provide your information to others, different practices may apply to
          the use or disclosure of the information that you provide to them. Vr
          technocraft does not control the privacy policies of third parties. Vr
          technocraft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices
          of API users, or other websites on the Internet, even those linked to
          or from the Services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies
          and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal
          information to them. For the purposes of European law, these sellers
          and API users are independent controllers of data, which means that
          they are responsible for providing and complying with their own
          policies relating to any personal information they obtain in
          connection with the Services.

          Necessary for the performance of the contract between Vr technocraft
          and its members
        </h2>
        <p>
          Vr technocraft provides a voluntary service; you can choose whether or
          not you want to use the Services. However, if you want to use the
          Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the
          contract between Vr technocraft and its members. As we operate in
          countries worldwide (including in the US) and use technical
          infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance
          with the contract between us, we need to transfer your personal
          information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to
          provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the
          Services and perform our contract with you without moving your
          personal information around the world.

          Security of your Personal Information
        </h2>
        <p>
          Vr technocraft secures your personal information from unauthorized
          access, use or disclosure. When sensitive personal information (such
          as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is
          protected through the use of encryption, such as the Transport Layer
          Security (TLS) protocol.
        </p>
        <h2 id="retention">Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Vr technocraft will retain your information only for as long as is
          necessary for the purposes set out in this policy, for as long as your
          account is active, as described in this policy, or as needed to
          provide the Services to you. If you no longer want Vr technocraft to
          use your information to provide the Services to you, you may close
          your account. Vr technocraft will retain and use your information to
          the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for
          example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with
          applicable tax/revenue laws), resolve disputes, enforce our
          agreements, and as otherwise described in this policy. Please note
          that closing your account may not free up your email address for reuse
          on a new account. We also retain log files for internal analysis

          NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you live in California, you also have rights under the California
          Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) to request certain information from
          certain businesses that collect that information from you. We are
          generally a service provider of the websites with whom you interact
          (for example, we’re a service provider of the website with a contact
          form using Vr technocraft). Where we are a service provider, the
          website is the “business” under CCPA and you can exercise your CCPA
          rights directly with your website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the rights that CCPA gives to California residents that you
          may exercise:
        </p>
        <h3 id="right-to-know">Right to Know</h3>
        <p>
          You may have the right to request, up to twice in a 12-month period,
          to see the following information about the personal information Vr
          technocraft has collected about you during the past 12 months:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The categories and specific pieces of personal information Vr
            technocraft has collected about you;
          </li>
          <li>
            The categories of sources from which Vr technocraft collected the
            personal information;
          </li>
          <li>
            The business or commercial purpose for which Vr technocraft
            collected the personal information;
          </li>
          <li>
            The categories of third parties with whom Vr technocraft shared the
            personal information; and
          </li>
          <li>
            The categories of personal information about you that Vr technocraft
            disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of third
            parties to whom Vr technocraft disclosed that information for a
            business purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            California law gives you the right to ask if Vr technocraft
            discloses your personal information to third parties for their
            direct marketing purposes. You also have the right to know if Vr
            technocraft sells your personal information, and if they do, to opt
            out of such sale. Vr technocraft does not sell your personal
            information to third parties.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="right-of-deletion">Right of Deletion</h3>
        <p>
          You can ask Vr technocraft to delete the personal information they
          have collected from you (subject to exceptions the law provides).
        </p>
        <h3 id="right-of-non-discrimination">Right of Non-Discrimination</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to not be discriminated against if you exercise
          these privacy rights. Vr technocraft cannot discriminate against you,
          deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different quality of
          goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.

          To make such a request, contact Vr technocraft at{" "}

          . All such requests are subject to verification of the identity of the
          requestor and the legitimacy of the request. We respond to all
          legitimate CCPA data requests within 45 days. We take steps to
          determine whether the request is legitimate, but this does not extend
          the 45 days. The time period to provide the information may be
          extended once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary, and
          in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

        <p>
          To the extent we act as the website’s service provider (for example,
          when we process your submissions on their behalf), you can exercise
          your CCPA rights directly with the website(s) you use.

        <h2 id="your-responsibilities">Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          If you use Vr technocraft’s API, you may receive and determine what to
          do with certain personal information, such as when communicating with
          users. This means you process personal information (for example, email
          address, and name) and, to the extent you do so, under EU law, you are
          an independent controller of data relating to other users that you may
          have obtained through the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for protecting user personal information you
          receive or process and complying with all relevant legal requirements
          when you use the Services. This includes applicable data protection
          and privacy laws that govern the ways in which you can use a user’s
          information. Such laws may require that you post, and comply with,
          your own privacy policy, which must be accessible to Vr technocraft
          users you interact with and compatible with this policy and Vr
          technocraft’s Terms of Use. For more information on the General Data
          Protection Regulation, see more resources at{" "}

        </p>
        <p>
          As a data controller, to the extent that you process user personal
          information outside of the Services, you may be required under
          applicable data protection and privacy laws to honor requests for data
          access, portability, correction, deletion, and objections to
          processing. Also, if you disclose personal information without the
          user’s proper consent, you are responsible for that unauthorized
          disclosure. This includes, for example, disclosures you make or
          unintentional data breaches. For example, you may receive a user’s
          email address or other information as a result of entering into a
          relationship with that user. This information may only be used for Vr
          technocraft-related communications or for Vr technocraft-facilitated
          transactions. You may not use this information for unsolicited
          commercial messages or unauthorized transactions. Without the user’s
          consent, and subject to other applicable Vr technocraft policies and
          laws, you may not add any Vr technocraft member to your email or
          physical mailing list or use that user’s identity for marketing.
          Please bear in mind that you’re responsible for knowing the standard
          of consent required in any given instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Vr technocraft and you are found to be joint data controllers of
          personal information, and if Vr technocraft is sued, fined, or
          otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did as a joint
          data controller of buyer personal information, you agree to indemnify
          Vr technocraft for the expenses it occurs in connection with your
          processing of user personal information.

          Where you have provided your consent, you have the right to withdraw
          your consent to our processing of your information and your use of the
          Services. For example, you can withdraw your consent to email
          marketing by using the unsubscribe link in such communications or by
          changing your account settings. You can choose to withdraw your
          consent to our processing of your information and your use of the

          settings and then emailing{" "}

          respect your privacy and give you an opportunity to opt-out of
