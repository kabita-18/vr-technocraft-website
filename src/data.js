        description:
        ` An Access Control System (ACS) is a security system that controls access to a physical or digital space, device, or network by limiting who or what can enter, exit, or use the resources within that space. The primary goal of an ACS is to ensure that only authorized individuals or entities are granted access, while keeping unauthorized people or intruders out.
       Access control systems use a variety of technologies, such as passwords, biometric identification (fingerprint, retina, face), access cards, key fobs, and smart phones to authenticate and authorize access. Access can be granted or denied based on the identity of the user, time of day, location, and other factors.
        ACS can be implemented in a variety of environments, including homes, offices, data centers, airports, hospitals, and other public places. ACS can also be integrated with other security systems, such as CCTV cameras, intrusion detection systems, and alarms to provide a more comprehensive security solution. `
